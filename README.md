|**RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**|
|<p>**Research on 3D detection for LiDAR point cloud**           (September 2020 - now)</p><p>**Final year project**,  supervised by **Prof. Chi Wing Fu**</p><p>- Incorporate and refine Border Alignment Module innovated by BorderDet to our baseline model, which is able to make the use of the information on the border of coarse predicted bounding boxes to refine the confidence and the regression. Adapt the module to rotated bounding boxes. Adapt the module to our case when there are multiple anchors for one pixel. Improve efficiency of the module by pre-selection mechanism. This module improves 3D mAP in 40 points by 0.4%.</p><p>- Incorporate the traditional semi-supervised module and mean teacher module to try to improve the performance of the baseline model based on SECOND v1.5. The work is composed into a paper submitted to **CVPR 2021 (also accepted)** conference.</p><p>- Try to design learnable Non-maximum Suppression module to make it adaptable for different objects.</p><p>- Participate in doing experiments to tune parameters for the model.</p><p></p><p>**Summer research on 3D detection for LiDAR point cloud**  (May 2020 – August 2020)</p><p>**Summer research assistant**, supervised by **Prof. Chi Wing Fu**</p><p>On The Chinese University of Hong Kong</p><p>- Design novel Non-maximum Suppression(NMS) module to better handle the sparsity characteristic for point cloud scenes. Improve mAP by 0.3% on the baseline. The work is composed into a paper, **accepted** by **AAAI 2021** conference.</p><p>- ` `Try to improve the performance of the model by improving the prediction accuracy along the z axis. Fusion the information from the BEV view, the front view and the left view to give predictions.</p><p>- Participate in doing experiments to tune parameters for the model.</p><p></p><p>**Summer research on Robust NLP**                      (May 2019 – August 2019)</p><p>**Summer research assistant**, supervised by **Michael R. Lyu**</p><p>On The Chinese University of Hong Kong</p><p>- Design an effective adversarial attack module specified for NLP model which is able to generate semantic and syntactic correct adversarial examples that misguides the model to generate totally wrong results.</p><p>- Study the reason why NLP models can be not robust. The deficiency of word embedding method is one of the root cause for the non-robustness of the model.</p><p></p>|
